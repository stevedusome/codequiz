# codequiz

-working quiz

-needs time to be reduced on wrong answer

-needs scoreboard:
created 2 parallel categories of localstorage that unpack match, sort, and then refile

This could have been done with object oriented programming, using a for loop and writing the questions and answers as objects and arrays, but because it was a short quiz, i opted for leaving it as a series of steps in an array. Future areas for improvement would be, implementing that, and also implementing randomization of both the question order, and the order of the answers
